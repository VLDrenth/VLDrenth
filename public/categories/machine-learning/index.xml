      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-basics&#34;&gt;The basics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first &amp;lsquo;machine learning&amp;rsquo; many will come across is LASSO regression. This may suggest that it&amp;rsquo;s an elementary method; something to get you started on machine learning before moving to the more interesting topics. But there is a sea of methods that are adaptions of LASSO. The goal of this blog post is to give a brief overview of the landscape of these methods and where they might be useful. Understanding these other methods, many of which generalize the LASSO, should also help us gain a better understanding (and appreciation) of the &amp;lsquo;simple&amp;rsquo; version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
