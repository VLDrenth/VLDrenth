This blog is made for me to learn in public about topics that interest me and motivate myself to actually write out what I learn. Topics that interest me are somewhere at the intersection of statistical learning, Bayesian statistics, time-series analysis, and deep learning. Expect butchered interpretations of classic textbooks, discussion of papers far beyond my comprehension, and other fun stuff!
